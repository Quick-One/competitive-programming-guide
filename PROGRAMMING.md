# A Guide to Competitive Programming

If you're here, that probably means you're done with setup. Well done getting this far! You are now about to take your first step towards becoming a competitive programmer. No turning back now. Let's start off with...

Algorithms
----------

There's nothing much for me to say here - plenty of amazing competitive programmers have already put up numerous resources around the web. A couple of interesting resources have been added to the [books](books/) folder - do take a look. These include:
- [The Competitive Programmer's Handbook](books/Competitive%20Programmerâ€™s%20Handbook.pdf)
- [An Introduction to The USA Computing Olympiad](books/An%20Introduction%20to%20The%20USA%20Computing%20Olympiad.pdf)

Also, here are a couple of websites with useful resources -
- [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide)

If you have to choose, prioritise the books - they try to give you a complete overview of various algorithmic techniques.

Programming
-----------

Again, plenty of amazing resources out on the web. A few links I personally found helpful -
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org) (Great for just general programming as well)
- [Learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)

Practice
--------

As in most things, practice is key in competitive programming. The platform of choice for many at the Coding Club is [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com). Register using the link on the top right, with a personal email (university mails may not be accessible once you graduate). Here's a [nice article](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/68288) that explains how the CodeForces rating system works.

When getting started, try to give Div. 3 (<1600 rating) and Div. 4 (<1400) contests regularly. If you can't solve a problem, move on to the next one. But once you have no problems left, try to solve the earlier ones again - there may be an obvious solution you have missed.

### Upsolving

Another key concept is known as _upsolving_. Try to make a habit of solving one question after every contest that you were unable to solve during the contest time. Implementing harder questions will help you speed up your solving and improve your performance. 

### Editorials

After every contest, CodeForces releases an "editorial" with solutions for all the problems. This is usually linked in the contest announcement post on the front page. Try your hand at the problems first, but if you still don't get one, read through the editorial to understand its solution.

### Other sites

The world of Competitive Programming is vast, and you may find that one day, you don't want to limit yourself to just CodeForces. Some good contest sites (ranked by personal preference):

- [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
    - Does not host contests, but has algorithmic problems with a wide variety in difficulty. Valuable resource for practice.
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com)
    - A popular site among Indian coders. Rating tends to be easier to gain then CodeForces, so preferred by some beginners. Contests for higher divisions are harder to find.
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)
    - Good for practice for beginners, with problem recommendations as well. High-level problems number in the dozens, so easy to outgrow.
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp)
    - Similar to CodeForces, this site was originally in Japanese, but now targets a worldwide audience. Contests tend to have a heavy focus on graph problems.

# And... we're done!

If you've followed along till this point, you're in a good position as a new competitive programmer.  Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Continue giving contests and learning new concepts, and you'll be well on your way to that beautiful  ðŸ”´ red ðŸ”´ rating on CodeForces. If you want more resources, [this awesome list](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming) by @inishan provides links to plenty.
